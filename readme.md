# SuperLauncher
Superlauncher is supposed to be a meta-launcher, almost like Valve's Steam. However, that is where the similarities end. SuperLauncher is intended to handle multiple existing installations of the same game, and is specially designed for cases where launching the game from different directories then what is the default simply won't work.#
